# custommultifieldexample

This is an example component of how to use the CustomMultiField widget. This component creates an FAQs collection.

The `dialog.xml` file defines the CQ configuration dialog, which can be seen [here](https://raw.github.com/byktol/cq-widgetry/master/images/custommultifieldexample/cq-dialog.png).

The `custommultifieldexample.jsp` file contains the rendering logic. I do not recomment the use of a scriptlet in the JSP (as illustrated by lines 10 to 15), but I've done so for demonstration purposes only.
